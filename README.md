# This submission

This repository is a RoboSynChallenge 2026 submission. What is submitted, which
checkpoint each of the ten tasks uses, what was verified and what was not are all
described in **[`SUBMISSION.md`](SUBMISSION.md)** — read that first.

Evaluation uses the unchanged official command, one task at a time:

```bash
bash policy/smolvla_multitask/eval.sh <task_name> random <gpu_id>
```

Five tasks route to a pi0 backend behind that same command. Their environment is
built once by `bash policy/smolvla_multitask/setup_pi0.sh`, which needs a CPython
3.11 interpreter, EmbodiChain placed as a sibling directory of this repository,
and access to `github.com`; see "Install prerequisites" in `SUBMISSION.md`.

The engineering acceptance of this submission passed 9 of the 10 tasks and is
FAILED as a whole: `item_assembly` writes correct metrics but its process exits
139 in the simulator's teardown. `SUBMISSION.md` states this in full.

# Installtion
Based on the [**EmbodiChain**](https://dexforce.github.io/EmbodiChain/main/quick_start/install.html), we offer both `docker` and `local` installation methods. For detailed installation instructions, please refer to [**Installation Document**](https://edem-ai.github.io/RoboSynChallenge/html/getting_started/installation.html).

# Datasets
We provide 1,000 pre-collected trajectories per task as part of the open-source release **RoboSynChallenge** Dataset. The datasets hosted on HuggingFace are available at [here](https://edem-ai.github.io/robosynchallenge.github.io/#/data).

However, we still strongly recommend users to perform data collection themselves. For detailed data collection instructions, please refer to [**Data Collection Document**](https://edem-ai.github.io/RoboSynChallenge/html/tutorials/collect_data.html).


# Training and Evaluation
Currently, RoboSynChallenge integrates training and evaluation for <a href="https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi">PI0</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi">PI0.5</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/thu-ml/Motus">Motus</a>. Detailed procedures can be found in the documentation for the corresponding strategies: 👉<a href="https://edem-ai.github.io/RoboSynChallenge/html/tutorials/policy/index.html">Webpage</a>.
In addition, you can easily extend your own policys for training and evaluation by following the documentation 👉<a href="https://edem-ai.github.io/RoboSynChallenge/html/tutorials/policy/your_own_policy.html.html">Webpage</a>.

# Released Checkpoint Results

100-episode simulation evaluations for the released ACT and Diffusion Policy checkpoints are published in [`evaluation_results`](evaluation_results/README.md). The machine-readable result file pins success rate, action steps, millisecond inference time, Hugging Face checkpoint revisions, and the `random` protocol configuration.

# LeaderBoard
The full leaderboard and setting can be found in: https://edem-ai.github.io/robosynchallenge.github.io/#/leaderboard.
